## Grettings, traveller

I am a C/C++ programmer, I'm not really that active on GitHub so you won't find a lot of reposiories here since I like to keep personal projects to myself.
You respect me, and that's the **ONLY** rule you should remember (as well as my name of course).
Currently, I do most of my projects in either C or C++ but I do have some side language I do mostly because I hate myself. Those languages are Lua, C# and possibly some other stuff that I am to lazy to write down.

I hope you have a nice day.
Bye!
