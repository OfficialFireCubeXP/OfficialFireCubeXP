## Grettings, traveller

I am a C/C++ programmer. I'm not really that active on GitHub, so you won't find a lot of repositories here, since I like to keep personal projects to myself. You respect me, and that's the ONLY rule you should remember (as well as my name, of course). Currently, I do most of my projects in either C or C++, but I also use some side languagesâ€”mostly because I hate myself. Those languages are Lua, C#, and possibly some other stuff that I'm too lazy to write down.

I hope you have a nice day. Bye!
